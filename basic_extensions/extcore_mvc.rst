ExtCore.Mvc
===========

By default, ExtCore web applications are not MVC ones. MVC support is provided for them by ExtCore.Mvc extension.
This extension initializes MVC, makes it possible to use controllers, view components, views (added as resources
and/or precompiled), static content (added as resources) from other extensions etc.
