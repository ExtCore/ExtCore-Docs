ExtCore.Data
============

By default, ExtCore doesn’t know anything about data and storage, but you can use ExtCore.Data extension to have
unified approach to working with data and single storage context among all the extensions. Currently it supports
Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSql and SQLite, but it is very easy to add another storage support.
